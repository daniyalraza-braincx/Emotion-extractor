The funds are being used to build out the product, grow the team, ensure compliance, and expand our go-to-market efforts.\n\nAs for milestones, the big goals for the next few quarters are to complete our full production suite for EHR and payer integrations, and to scale up to over 1,000 providers using the platform. The target is to reach $350,000 in monthly recurring revenue by the fourth quarter of 2026. The company\u2019s longer-term goal is to reach profitability with $1.2 million in total funding, and to be ready for a potential exit with $6 million raised.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can connect you with the founders or send you more detailed ",

EasyPA is already ahead of the curve, fully compliant and ready for the 2026 CMS rules, which puts us in a great position as the industry shifts.\n\nSecond, our team is made up of experienced healthcare and technology leaders who really understand the pain points from both sides\u2014clinical and technical. That\u2019s helped us build a product that\u2019s not just smart, but actually easy for clinics to use and adopt.\n\nThird, EasyPA\u2019s technology is unique.

We\u2019re also one of the only platforms that offers a full-cycle solution, from detection to appeals, and we\u2019re already seeing strong early traction with clinics and partners.\n\nFinally, the business model is recurring revenue, which means predictable growth as we scale. With the upcoming mandates, the demand is only going to increase.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can help set up a meeting with the founders so you can ask more detailed questions and get a feel for the team and vision.

Here\u2019s how EasyPA fits into your workflow with electronic health records (EHRs) and payers.\n\nEasyPA connects directly to your EHR system\u2014like Epic, Cerner, athenahealth, eClinicalWorks, and many others\u2014using secure, industry-standard protocols. When a provider needs to submit a prior authorization, they can do it right from their EHR. EasyPA pulls in the necessary patient and clinical information automatically, so there\u2019s no need for double entry.\n\nOnce the request is ready, EasyPA submits it electronically to any of the 900+ insurance payers we\u2019re connected with, including all the major ones like UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, Cigna, and Medicare. The platform also checks eligibility in real time and tracks the status of each request, so you always know where things stand.\n\nIf you want, I can explain more about the integration process or how the AI helps with documentation and approvals.

Let me walk you through how integration and onboarding work, and how you can get started with your own provider.\n\nThe integration process with EasyPA is designed to be simple and fast. Since EasyPA is a web-based platform, there\u2019s no need for complicated technical setup or software installation.

Our team handles the connection, so your clinic can start using EasyPA right away\u2014usually with just a web browser.\n\nFor onboarding, once you sign up, we provide training for your staff and set up your account. You\u2019ll have access to support, marketing materials, and a dedicated partner success manager to help you every step of the way. We make sure your team feels comfortable and confident using the platform.\n\nTo get started with your own provider, you just need to sign up on our website or reach out to our team. We\u2019ll guide you through the setup, connect your EHR if you want, and get you up and running quickly.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can share more details about pricing, features, or even set up a demo for you.

This rule means that providers must submit prior authorizations electronically whenever possible, and payers have to respond much faster\u2014within 72 hours for urgent requests. The goal is to reduce delays, improve transparency, and make sure patients get care without unnecessary holdups.\n\nThis mandate is a major reason why companies like EasyPA are focused on automation and electronic solutions. We\u2019re already set up to meet these new requirements, so practices using EasyPA will be ready for compliance and won\u2019t have to worry about last-minute changes.\n\nIf you want more details about the CMS rule or how it might affect your practice, just let me know, Kway!"

Dr. Paola Ballester, our CEO, is a Medical Director of Utilization Management at a children\u2019s hospital, with over 15 years of experience leading pediatric care teams and working on the administrative side of healthcare. She\u2019s passionate about making the process easier for both providers and patients.\n\nOur CTO, Alex Vega, is a senior AI software engineer with more than 20 years of experience building secure, scalable systems for healthcare and fintech. He\u2019s an expert in cloud infrastructure and API integrations, which is a big part of why EasyPA is so seamless to use.\n\nDr. Ralph Martello, our Chief Product & Operating Officer, is a board-certified pediatric hospitalist and an expert in clinical workflow automation. He leads our product vision and user experience, making sure the platform truly fits the needs of real-world providers.\n\nThe team came together because they saw a huge need for smarter, faster solutions in healthcare administration. They wanted to build something that would actually make a difference for clinics, hospitals, and patients.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about investment opportunities or want to connect with the founders directly, I can help set that up for you, Kway!"

Right now, we\u2019re in the middle of a $1.2 million pre-seed SAFE round. The funds are being used to build out the product, grow the team, ensure compliance, and expand our go-to-market efforts.\n\nAs for milestones, the big goals for the next few quarters are to complete our full production suite for EHR and payer integrations, and to scale up to over 1,000 providers using the platform. The target is to reach $350,000 in monthly recurring revenue by the fourth quarter of 2026. The company\u2019s longer-term goal is to reach profitability with $1.2 million in total funding, and to be ready for a potential exit with $6 million raised.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can connect you with the founders or send you more detailed "

EasyPA is already ahead of the curve, fully compliant and ready for the 2026 CMS rules, which puts us in a great position as the industry shifts.\n\nSecond, our team is made up of experienced healthcare and technology leaders who really understand the pain points from both sides\u2014clinical and technical. That\u2019s helped us build a product that\u2019s not just smart, but actually easy for clinics to use and adopt.\n\nThird, EasyPA\u2019s technology is unique. Our AI-driven platform automates the entire prior auth process, reduces denials, and saves clinics a ton of time and money. We\u2019re also one of the only platforms that offers a full-cycle solution, from detection to appeals, and we\u2019re already seeing strong early traction with clinics and partners.\n\nFinally, the business model is recurring revenue, which means predictable growth as we scale. With the upcoming mandates, the demand is only going to increase.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can help set up a meeting with the founders so you can ask more detailed questions and get a feel for the team and vision. Just let me know what works best for you, Kway!"

EasyPA pulls in the necessary patient and clinical information automatically, so there\u2019s no need for double entry.\n\nOnce the request is ready, EasyPA submits it electronically to any of the 900+ insurance payers we\u2019re connected with, including all the major ones like UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, Cigna, and Medicare. The platform also checks eligibility in real time and tracks the status of each request, so you always know where things stand.\n\nIf you want, I can explain more about the integration process or how the AI helps with documentation and approvals. Just let me know what interests you most, "

The funds are being used to build out the product, grow the team, ensure compliance, and expand our go-to-market efforts.\n\nAs for milestones, the big goals for the next few quarters are to complete our full production suite for EHR and payer integrations, and to scale up to over 1,000 providers using the platform. The target is to reach $350,000 in monthly recurring revenue by the fourth quarter of 2026. The company\u2019s longer-term goal is to reach profitability with $1.2 million in total funding, and to be ready for a potential exit with $6 million raised.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can connect you with the founders or send you more detailed "

When a provider needs to submit a prior authorization, they can do it right from their EHR. EasyPA pulls in the necessary patient and clinical information automatically, so there\u2019s no need for double entry.\n\nOnce the request is ready, EasyPA submits it electronically to any of the 900+ insurance payers we\u2019re connected with, including all the major ones like UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, Cigna, and Medicare. The platform also checks eligibility in real time and tracks the status of each request, so you always know where things stand.\n\nIf you want, I can explain more about the integration process or how the AI helps with documentation and approvals.

This rule means that providers must submit prior authorizations electronically whenever possible, and payers have to respond much faster\u2014within 72 hours for urgent requests. The goal is to reduce delays, improve transparency, and make sure patients get care without unnecessary holdups.\n\nThis mandate is a major reason why companies like EasyPA are focused on automation and electronic solutions. We\u2019re already set up to meet these new requirements, so practices using EasyPA will be ready for compliance and won\u2019t have to worry about last-minute changes.\n\nIf you want more details about the CMS rule or how it might affect your practice, just let me know, Kway!"

He\u2019s an expert in cloud infrastructure and API integrations, which is a big part of why EasyPA is so seamless to use.\n\nDr. Ralph Martello, our Chief Product & Operating Officer, is a board-certified pediatric hospitalist and an expert in clinical workflow automation. He leads our product vision and user experience, making sure the platform truly fits the needs of real-world providers.\n\nThe team came together because they saw a huge need for smarter, faster solutions in healthcare administration.

There are a few big names in the prior authorization and healthcare automation space\u2014some of the main competitors include Waystar, Availity, Innovaccer, Cohere Health, and Anterior.

First, we have a proprietary Denial Genome dataset, which makes our AI models more accurate at predicting and preventing denials. Our platform covers the full cycle\u2014from detecting when a prior authorization is needed, to submitting, tracking, and even appealing denials\u2014all in one workflow. Most competitors only handle part of that process.\n\nEasyPA is also built with a \u201cFHIR-first\u201d approach, so it\u2019s already compliant with the latest CMS interoperability rules and future-proof for upcoming mandates. Plus, our workflows are designed by physicians, which "

There are a few strong reasons why EasyPA stands out as an investment opportunity.\n\nFirst, the prior authorization market is huge and growing, especially with the new federal mandates pushing every provider and payer to adopt electronic solutions. EasyPA is already ahead of the curve, fully compliant and ready for the 2026 CMS rules, which puts us in a great position as the industry shifts.\n\nSecond, our team is made up of experienced healthcare and technology leaders who really understand the pain points from both sides\u2014clinical and technical. That\u2019s helped us build a product that\u2019s not just smart, but actually easy for clinics to use and adopt.\n\nThird, EasyPA\u2019s technology is unique. Our AI-driven platform automates the entire prior auth process, reduces denials, and saves clinics a ton of time and money. We\u2019re also one of the only platforms that offers a full-cycle solution, from detection to appeals, and we\u2019re already seeing strong early traction with clinics and partners.\n\nFinally, the business model is recurring revenue, which means predictable growth as we scale. With the upcoming mandates, the demand is only going to increase.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can help set up a meeting with the founders so you can ask more detailed questions and get a feel for the team and vision. Just let me know what works best for you, Kway!"

EasyPA is already ahead of the curve, fully compliant and ready for the 2026 CMS rules, which puts us in a great position as the industry shifts.\n\nSecond, our team is made up of experienced healthcare and technology leaders who really understand the pain points from both sides\u2014clinical and technical. That\u2019s helped us build a product that\u2019s not just smart, but actually easy for clinics to use and adopt.\n\nThird, EasyPA\u2019s technology is unique. Our AI-driven platform automates the entire prior auth process, reduces denials, and saves clinics a ton of time and money. We\u2019re also one of the only platforms that offers a full-cycle solution, from detection to appeals, and we\u2019re already seeing strong early traction with clinics and partners.\n\nFinally, the business model is recurring revenue, which means predictable growth as we scale. With the upcoming mandates, the demand is only going to increase.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can help set up a meeting with the founders so you can ask more detailed questions and get a feel for the team and vision.

The goal is to reduce delays, improve transparency, and make sure patients get care without unnecessary holdups.\n\nThis mandate is a major reason why companies like EasyPA are focused on automation and electronic solutions. We\u2019re already set up to meet these new requirements, so practices using EasyPA will be ready for compliance and won\u2019t have to worry about last-minute changes.\n\nIf you want more details about the CMS rule or how it might affect your practice, just let me know, Kway!"

Here\u2019s how EasyPA fits into your workflow with electronic health records (EHRs) and payers.\n\nEasyPA connects directly to your EHR system\u2014like Epic, Cerner, athenahealth, eClinicalWorks, and many others\u2014using secure, industry-standard protocols. When a provider needs to submit a prior authorization, they can do it right from their EHR. EasyPA pulls in the necessary patient and clinical information automatically, so there\u2019s no need for double entry.\n\nOnce the request is ready, EasyPA submits it electronically to any of the 900+ insurance payers we\u2019re connected with, including all the major ones like UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, Cigna, and Medicare. The platform also checks eligibility in real time and tracks the status of each request, so you always know where things stand.\n\nIf you want, I can explain more about the integration process or how the AI helps with documentation and approvals.

Since EasyPA is a web-based platform, there\u2019s no need for complicated technical setup or software installation.

Our team handles the connection, so your clinic can start using EasyPA right away\u2014usually with just a web browser.\n\nFor onboarding, once you sign up, we provide training for your staff and set up your account. You\u2019ll have access to support, marketing materials, and a dedicated partner success manager to help you every step of the way. We make sure your team feels comfortable and confident using the platform.\n\nTo get started with your own provider, you just need to sign up on our website or reach out to our team.

This rule means that providers must submit prior authorizations electronically whenever possible, and payers have to respond much faster\u2014within 72 hours for urgent requests. The goal is to reduce delays, improve transparency, and make sure patients get care without unnecessary holdups.\n\nThis mandate is a major reason why companies like EasyPA are focused on automation and electronic solutions. We\u2019re already set up to meet these new requirements, so practices using EasyPA will be ready for compliance and won\u2019t have to worry about last-minute changes.\n\nIf you want more details about the CMS rule or how it might affect your practice, just let me know, Kway!"

Dr. Paola Ballester, our CEO, is a Medical Director of Utilization Management at a children\u2019s hospital, with over 15 years of experience leading pediatric care teams and working on the administrative side of healthcare. She\u2019s passionate about making the process easier for both providers and patients.\n\nOur CTO, Alex Vega, is a senior AI software engineer with more than 20 years of experience building secure, scalable systems for healthcare and fintech. He\u2019s an expert in cloud infrastructure and API integrations, which is a big part of why EasyPA is so seamless to use.\n\nDr. Ralph Martello, our Chief Product & Operating Officer, is a board-certified pediatric hospitalist and an expert in clinical workflow automation. He leads our product vision and user experience, making sure the platform truly fits the needs of real-world providers.\n\nThe team came together because they saw a huge need for smarter, faster solutions in healthcare administration. They wanted to build something that would actually make a difference for clinics, hospitals, and patients.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about investment opportunities or want to connect with the founders directly, I can help set that up for you, Kway!"

Right now, we\u2019re in the middle of a $1.2 million pre-seed SAFE round. The funds are being used to build out the product, grow the team, ensure compliance, and expand our go-to-market efforts.\n\nAs for milestones, the big goals for the next few quarters are to complete our full production suite for EHR and payer integrations, and to scale up to over 1,000 providers using the platform. The target is to reach $350,000 in monthly recurring revenue by the fourth quarter of 2026. The company\u2019s longer-term goal is to reach profitability with $1.2 million in total funding, and to be ready for a potential exit with $6 million raised.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can connect you with the founders or send you more detailed "

EasyPA is already ahead of the curve, fully compliant and ready for the 2026 CMS rules, which puts us in a great position as the industry shifts.\n\nSecond, our team is made up of experienced healthcare and technology leaders who really understand the pain points from both sides\u2014clinical and technical. That\u2019s helped us build a product that\u2019s not just smart, but actually easy for clinics to use and adopt.\n\nThird, EasyPA\u2019s technology is unique. Our AI-driven platform automates the entire prior auth process, reduces denials, and saves clinics a ton of time and money. We\u2019re also one of the only platforms that offers a full-cycle solution, from detection to appeals, and we\u2019re already seeing strong early traction with clinics and partners.\n\nFinally, the business model is recurring revenue, which means predictable growth as we scale. With the upcoming mandates, the demand is only going to increase.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can help set up a meeting with the founders so you can ask more detailed questions and get a feel for the team and vision. Just let me know what works best for you, Kway!"
